# Elixer

Below are some of Elixers Public Launch Scripts, used on the E2 launch system. 
To use this code, and modify it to your own craft, you will need **some** kOS experience.

You will never be using the current, up to date version of the code. DO YOUR OWN MODIFICATIONS!

## Updates (version 2.0.0)

* Maven Launch & Docking Script.
* EHeavy Launch Script (Landings Soon)

## Usage (boot files)

We don't provide the boot files needed to run this, however it is advised that you use AG6 for the orbit script
and then AG8 for the ASDS, or RTLS landing script. We have provided the code for actually doing the launches and landings.
You may need to add something like *wait until AGX* on the scripts, or do your own thing and run it from a boot file.

You will need **lib_lazcalc.ks** for **orbit.ks**.
For Maven flights, you will also need the **launchWindow.ks & libGNC.ks** scripts.
